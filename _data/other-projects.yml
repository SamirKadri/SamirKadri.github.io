    I was part of UofT's Formula Student team, where I designed and manufactured critical vehicle systems, specializing in high-performance suspension and aerodynamics components. By utilizing topology optimization, I developed rear suspension uprights specifically for in-hub motor integration and 5-axis CNC manufacturability, supported by detailed engineering drawings and GD&T standards. I also designed the front wing and nosecone assembly, incorporating optimized mounts that contributed to a 23.3% overall performance increase. My work extended into hands-on production, where I manufactured composite aerodynamic devices using 3D-printed and CNC foam molds. To ensure peak performance, the components were validated through professional-grade testing, including 4-post rig analysis at Multimatic and wind tunnel sessions at Ford Motors.

    My research and development work at the Turbulence Research Lab involves the advancement of active flow control through the development of a high-fidelity CFD model for Spark-Jet actuators. This model is designed to accurately simulate complex phenomena, including peak jet velocity, localized temperature rise, and the critical dynamics of flow reattachment. To handle the intensive computational requirements of these simulations, I execute complex COMSOL Multiphysics models on High-Performance Computing (HPC) clusters.

    Driven by the complexities of fluid behavior, I developed a high-fidelity CFD solver in Python to simulate steady, incompressible flow within various cavity geometries. The core of the solver implements the SIMPLE algorithm for pressure-velocity coupling, utilizing Rhie-Chow interpolation on a collocated, finite-volume grid to ensure numerical stability.

    During my tenure with the racing team, I led the end-to-end development of the vehicle's suspension package, bridging the gap between complex kinematic simulation and precision manufacturing. I began by establishing the vehicle's hardpoints and helped design the front uprights and steering components, utilizing Lotus Shark for suspension geometry optimization and Solidworks for robust 3D modeling.
